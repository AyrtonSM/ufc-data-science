    "These series of articles assume you have no knowledge of pandas, but that you understand the fundamentals of the Python programming language. It also assumes that you have installed pandas on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get pandas along with Python and the rest of the main scientific computing libraries is to install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have no knowledge of Python then I suggest completing the following two books cover to cover before even touching pandas. They are both free.\n",
    "* [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey\n",

    "# The importance of making subset selections\n",
    "You might be wondering why there needs to be so many articles on selecting subsets of data. This topic is extremely important to pandas and it's unfortunate that it is fairly complicated because subset selection happens frequently during an actual analysis. Because you are frequently making subset selections, you need to master it in order to make your life with pandas easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will also be doing a follow-up series on index alignment which is another extremely important topic that requires you to understand subset selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Always reference the documentation\n",
    "The material in this article is also covered in the official pandas documentation on [Indexing and Selecting Data](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html). I highly recommend that you read that part of the documentation along with this tutorial. In fact, the documentation is one of the primary means for mastering pandas. I wrote a step-by-step article, [How to Learn Pandas](https://medium.com/dunder-data/how-to-learn-pandas-108905ab4955), which gives suggestions on how to use the documentation as you master pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The anatomy of a DataFrame and a Series\n",
    "The pandas library has two primary containers of data, the DataFrame and the Series. You will spend nearly all your time working with both of the objects when you use pandas. The DataFrame is used more than the Series, so let's take a look at an image of it first. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_dataframe_anatomy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This images comes with some added illustrations to highlight its components. At first glance, the DataFrame looks like any other two-dimensional table of data that you have seen. It has rows and it has columns. Technically, there are three main components of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The three components of a DataFrame\n",
    "A DataFrame is composed of three different components, the **index**, **columns**, and the **data**. The data is also known as the **values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index represents the sequence of values on the far left-hand side of the DataFrame. All the values in the index are in **bold** font. Each individual value of the index is called a **label**. Sometimes the index is referred to as the **row labels**. In the example above, the row labels are not very interesting and are just the integers beginning from 0 up to n-1, where n is the number of rows in the table. Pandas defaults DataFrames with this simple index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are the sequence of values at the very top of the DataFrame. They are also in **bold** font. Each individual value of the columns is called a **column**, but can also be referred to as **column name** or **column label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else not in bold font is the data or values. You will sometimes hear DataFrames referred to as **tabular** data. This is just another name for a rectangular table data with rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axis and axes\n",
    "It is also common terminology to refer to the rows or columns as an **axis**. Collectively, we call them **axes**. So, a row is an axis and a column is another axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The word axis appears as a parameter in many DataFrame methods. Pandas allows you to choose the direction of how the method will work with this parameter. This has nothing to do with subset selection so you can just ignore it for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each row has a label and each column has a label\n",
    "The main takeaway from the DataFrame anatomy is that each row has a label and each column has a label. These labels are used to refer to specific rows or columns in the DataFrame. It's the same as how humans use names to refer to specific people.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is subset selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start doing subset selection, it might be good to define what it is. Subset selection is simply selecting particular rows and columns of data from a DataFrame (or Series). This could mean selecting all the rows and some of the columns, some of the rows and all of the columns, or some of each of the rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example selecting some columns and all rows\n",
    "Let's see some images of subset selection. We will first look at a sample DataFrame with fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_sample_df.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to select just the columns `color`, `age`, and `height` but keep all the rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_just_cols.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final DataFrame would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_just_cols2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example selecting some rows and all columns\n",
    "We can also make selections that select just some of the rows. Let's select the rows with labels `Aaron` and `Dean` along with all of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_just_rows.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final DataFrame would like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_just_rows2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example selecting some rows and some columns\n",
    "Let's combine the selections from above and select the columns `color`, `age`, and `height` for only the rows with labels `Aaron` and `Dean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_rows_cols.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final DataFrame would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/01_rows_cols2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pandas dual references: by label and by integer location\n",
    "We already mentioned that each row and each column have a specific label that can be used to reference them. This is displayed in bold font in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what hasn't been mentioned, is that each row and column may be referenced by an integer as well. I call this **integer location**. The integer location begins at 0 and ends at n-1 for each row and column. Take a look above at our sample DataFrame one more time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rows with labels `Aaron` and `Dean` can also be referenced by their respective integer locations 2 and 4. Similarly, the columns `color`, `age` and `height` can be referenced by their integer locations 1, 3, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation refers to integer location as **position**. I don't particularly like this terminology as its not as explicit as integer location. The key thing term here is INTEGER.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What's the difference between indexing and selecting subsets of data?\n",
    "The documentation uses the term **indexing** frequently. This term is essentially just a one-word phrase to say 'subset selection'. I prefer the term subset selection as, again, it is more descriptive of what is actually happening. Indexing is also the term used in the official Python documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Focusing only on `[]`, `.loc`, and `.iloc`\n",
    "There are many ways to select subsets of data, but in this article we will only cover the usage of the square brackets (**`[]`**), **`.loc`** and **`.iloc`**. Collectively, they are called the **indexers**. These are by far the most common ways to select data. A different part of this Series will discuss a few methods that can be used to make subset selections. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a DataFrame, `df`, your subset selection will look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df[ ]\n",
    "df.loc[ ]\n",
    "df.iloc[ ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A real subset selection will have something inside of the square brackets. All selections in this article will take place inside of those square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the square brackets also follow `.loc` and `.iloc`. All indexing in Python happens inside of these square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A term for just those square brackets\n",
    "The term **indexing operator** is used to refer to the square brackets following an object. The **`.loc`** and **`.iloc`** indexers also use the indexing operator to make selections. I will use the term **just the indexing operator** to refer to **`df[]`**. This will distinguish it from **`df.loc[]`** and **`df.iloc[]`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read in data into a DataFrame with `read_csv`\n",
    "Let's begin using pandas to read in a DataFrame, and from there, use the indexing operator by itself to select subsets of data. All the data for these tutorials are in the **data** directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **`read_csv`** function to read in data into a DataFrame. We pass the path to the file as the first argument to the function. We will also use the **`index_col`** parameter to select the first column of data as the index (more on this later)."

    "\n",
    "* Before learning pandas, ensure you have the fundamentals of Python\n",
    "* Always refer to the documentation when learning new pandas operations\n",
    "* The DataFrame and the Series are the containers of data\n",
    "* A DataFrame is two-dimensional, tabular data\n",
    "* A Series is a single dimension of data\n",
    "* The three components of a DataFrame are the **index**, the **columns** and the **data** (or **values**)\n",
    "* Each row and column of the DataFrame is referenced by both a **label** and an **integer location**\n",
    "* There are three primary ways to select subsets from a DataFrame - **`[]`**, **`.loc`** and **`.iloc`**\n",
    "* I use the term **just the indexing operator** to refer to **`[]`** immediately following a DataFrame/Series\n",
    "* Just the indexing operator's primary purpose is to select a column or columns from a DataFrame\n",
    "* Using a single column name to just the indexing operator returns a single column of data as a Series\n",
    "* Passing multiple columns in a list to just the indexing operator returns a DataFrame\n",
    "* A Series has two components, the **index** and the **data** (**values**). It has no columns\n",
    "* **`.loc`** makes selections **only by label**\n",
    "* **`.loc`** can simultaneously select rows and columns\n",
    "* **`.loc`** can make selections with either a single label, a list of labels, or a slice of labels\n",
    "* **`.loc`** makes row selections first followed by column selections: **`df.loc[row_selection, col_selection]`**\n",
    "* **`.iloc`** is analogous to **.`loc`** but uses only **integer location** to refer to rows or columns.\n",
    "* **`.ix`** is deprecated and should never be used\n",
    "* **`.loc`** and **`.iloc`** work the same for Series except they only select based on the index as their are no columns\n",
    "* Pandas combines the power of python lists (selection via integer location) and dictionaries (selection by label)\n",
    "* You can use just the indexing operator to select rows from a DataFrame, but I recommend against this and instead sticking with the explicit **`.loc`** and **`.iloc`**\n",
    "* Normally data is imported without setting an index. Use the **`set_index`** method to use a column as an index.\n",
    "* You can select a single column as a Series from a DataFrame with dot notation"
