    "# Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is also available as a [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Boolean Indexing\n",
    "This is part 2 of a seven-part series on how to select subsets of data from a pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas offers a wide variety of options for subset selection which necessitates multiple articles. This series is broken down into the following 7 topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selection with `[]`, `.loc` and `.iloc`\n",
    "1. Boolean indexing\n",
    "1. Assigning subsets of data\n",
    "1. Selection with a MultiIndex\n",
    "1. Selecting subsets of data with methods\n",
    "1. Selections with other Index types\n",
    "1. Internals, Miscellaneous, and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 vs Part 2 subset selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of this series covered subset selection with `[]`, `.loc` and `.iloc`. All three of these **indexers** use either the row/column labels or their integer location to make selections. The actual **data** of the Series/DataFrame is not used at all during the selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2 of this series, on **boolean indexing**, we will select subsets of data based on the actual values of the data in the Series/DataFrame and NOT on their row/column labels or integer locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation on boolean selection\n",
    "I will always recommend reading the official documentation in addition to this tutorial when learning about boolean selection. The documentation uses more formal examples with dummy data, but is still an excellent resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation use the term **boolean indexing** but you will also see **boolean selection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Boolean Indexing from pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#boolean-indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Overflow Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we will use for this tutorial comes from [Stack Overflow's data explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new), which is a fantastic tool to gather an incredible amount of data from the site. You must know SQL in order to use the data explorer. The data explorer allows you to save queries. [Take a look at the query](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/768430/get-all-questions-and-answerers-from-tag) I used to collect the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The table below contains data on each question asked on stack overflow [tagged as pandas](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first question was asked March 30, 2011. Since then, more than 56,000 questions have been added as of December 2, 2017."

    "* Typically, you will first create a boolean Series with one of the 6 comparison operators\n",

    "* Use the **`isin`** method to test for multiple equalities in the same column\n",

    "* Can use the **`between`** Series method to test whether Series values are within a range\n",
    "* You can create complex criteria with the **and** (**`&`**), **or** (**`|`**), and **not** (**`~`**) logical operators\n",
